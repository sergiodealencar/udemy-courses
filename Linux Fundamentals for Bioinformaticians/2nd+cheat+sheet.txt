Here is a cheat sheet for `grep`, `sed`, `sort`, and `uniq` commands:

## grep
- `grep` is used to search for specific patterns or lines in a file.
- Syntax: `grep pattern file`
- Common options:
  - `-i`: Ignore case distinctions
  - `-v`: Invert the match, i.e., output lines not matching the pattern
  - ^: Match the beginning of a line
  - \|: Match either of two patterns

## sed
- `sed` is a powerful stream editor used to perform basic text transformations on a file.
- Syntax: `sed 's/pattern/replacement/g' file`
- Common commands:
  - `s`: Substitute the first occurrence of a pattern with a replacement
  - `g`: Substitute all occurrences of a pattern with a replacement (global)
  - `d`: Delete the current pattern space

## sort
- `sort` is used to sort lines of text in a file.
- Syntax: `sort file`
- Common options:
  - `-r`: Reverse the sort order
  - `-n`: Sort numerically
  - `-u`: To sort the lines in a file and remove duplicates

## uniq
- `uniq` is used to remove duplicate lines from a file.
- Syntax: `uniq file`
- Common options:
  - `-c`: Prefix lines with the number of occurrences
  - `-d`: Only output lines that are repeated
  - `-u`: Only output lines that are unique


## head
- head is used to display the first few lines of a file.
- Syntax: head file
- Common options:
-n: Display the first n lines of the file

- Example:

- head -n 3 file.txt
 the -n option is used to specify the number of lines to display, so here will read the first three lines of the file and display them to the terminal.

## less
- less is a pager program used to view the contents of a file.
- Syntax: less file
- Common commands:
- q: Quit the program
